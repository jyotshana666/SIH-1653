## Problem Title
AI-Driven Performance Evaluation System for DRDO Scientists
## Problem Description
The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) relies on scientific personnel for cutting-edge research and technological advancements. Assessing the performance of these scientists for promotions and project assignments is critical but often subjective. A structured, unbiased, and data-driven evaluation system is essential to ensure fairness and recognize true talent.
Problem Description : Currently, performance evaluation of scientific personnel is based on annual reports, project contributions, and expert committee reviews. However, this process is prone to subjectivity, inconsistency, and inefficiencies. An AI-driven system can standardize evaluations by incorporating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as research impact, innovation, collaboration, and leadership qualities.
The evaluation should consider multiple parameters, including:
  Research papers and patents,
  Contributions to ongoing projects,
  Problem-solving capabilities in critical missions,
  Leadership and teamwork,
  Knowledge of emerging technologies.
